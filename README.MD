# OpenGL Rendering Engine

## Overview:

This repositoy serves as a codebase for my OpenGL based graphics engine, initially built using C++ via a variety of libraries, but now refactored for full development in C. Currently, this project supports a variety of features such as:

- A custom-built model loading and rendering system, independent of libraries such as assimp
- A 3d skeletal animation system

In progress / future plans:

- Physics implementation (collision, inverse kinematics, etc...)
- Different camera implementations
- More complex lighting models
- More shaders (pixelized, cell-shading, etc...)
