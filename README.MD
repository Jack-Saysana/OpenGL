# OpenGL Rendering Engine

## Compilation and Running

**Important:** In order to compile the program, you must have a C compiler such as gcc

From inside the repo directory run the following command:

`make arch`

Once the program is compiled, a `main` executable should appear in the repo's root directory of the project. Run `main` in order to start the program.

## Overview:

This repository is currently being refactored to be purely built in C to improve performance and development. Furthermore, model loading will also be built from scratch, without usage of assimp. The below features will still be included.

~~This repository serves as a codebase for my OpenGl based graphics engine, built in C++ using, most notably, assimp, GLFW, glad and cglm. Currently, the project supports a variety of features such as:~~
 - ~~Shader support~~
 - ~~2D Textures~~
 - ~~A configurable camera~~
 - ~~Model importing and loading~~
 - ~~Cubemap usage~~
 - ~~Instancing~~
 - ~~Blinn-Phong based lighting~~
 - ~~Directional shadow mapping~~

~~## In Progress:~~

 - ~~Omni-directional shadow mapping~~
